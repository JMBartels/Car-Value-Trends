Python + Chemistry to model and optimize polymer-mediated drug delivery designs [@github](https://github.com/JMBartels/Delayed-Drug-Release)

## Part 1 : Modelling the System
![Membrane-use-design](/images/Film_Design.jpg)
* The problem and design
* Science of it: equations and explanation
* Initial plots of active drug concentration

## [Part 2 : Interactive Dashboard](https://delayed-drug-release-app.onrender.com)

* Interactive data visualization using Plotly Dash
* Try making a membrane that is "just right"

## Part 3 : Machine Learning
  <img src="/images/SimFIlm_actual_vs_pred.png" width="400">
* Simulate a database of membrane performance (if it is safe, time to activate, and duration of drug activity) 
* Build and train a Neural Network on the database
* Visualize model quality
